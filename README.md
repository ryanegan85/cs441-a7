Assignment 7 for CS441, Android game using framework from assignment 6.

Welcome to Janken Tower! Named after the Japanese word for 
Rock-Paper-Scissors, this game involves defeating enemies 
by using their counter (rock, paper, or scissors) against them 
to progress through the tower, increasing your score. 
A more detailed explanation can be found in the games 
instructions section.

HOW TO RUN AND COMPILE
Open the directory "cs441-a7" in Android Studio and click "run" to compile and run the code.
This app was made and testing using a Nexus 5 emulator.

NOTABLE DATA STRUCTURES
The high scores are stored using Androids Shared Preferences feature. These are then read out
and stored into a HiScoreEntry object, containing two ArrayLists of Strings, one for the names
and one for the scores.
